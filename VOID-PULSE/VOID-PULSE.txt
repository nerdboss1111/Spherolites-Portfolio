Backstory
Born during the Neon Eclipse, when digital energies from the Nexus Grid merged with the ancient spirits of the Graffiti Islands, VOID-PULSE emerged from the fusion of technology and mysticism. Abandoned as a child in the Outskirt Zones, they survived by scavenging tech scraps and studying forbidden shamanic arts. After a near-fatal encounter with the Corporate Purge Squads, their consciousness was saved by being transferred into a specialized Spherolite vessel by underground tech-shamans. Rising through the ranks of the D'MONAI collective, they now serve as their chief enforcer, protecting street artists and maintaining order in the lawless sectors of the Islands. Their reputation for dispensing swift and supernatural justice has made even the most hardened cyber-gangs fear the sight of their pulsing purple sphere approaching through the neon fog.

Skills
Neuro-Tagging: Can project psychic graffiti tags that mark targets for spiritual tracking across the urban landscape.
Void Whispers: Ability to commune with the forgotten digital ghosts that haunt abandoned servers, extracting secrets and information.
Pulse Disruption: Can emit concentrated energy waves that temporarily disable electronic systems and disorient opponents.
Spectral Shifting: Can phase between physical and digital planes, allowing them to pass through walls and materialize unexpectedly.
Personality
VOID-PULSE embodies rebellion against both corporate control and conventional reality. They operate by a strict code of street justice, fiercely loyal to fellow artists but merciless toward those who threaten the creative sanctity of the Graffiti Islands. Their communication style is cryptic and fragmented, often speaking in glitched phrases and symbolic imagery that can be disorienting to outsiders. Despite their intimidating presence, they show unexpected compassion toward young taggers and displaced citizens. When provoked, their calm demeanor rapidly shifts to calculated aggression, with their spherical head pulsing more intensely with purple energy as their anger rises. They trust few, but those who earn their respect become lifelong allies defended with supernatural vigor.
